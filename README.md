1. Matplotlib
2. NumPy
3. Pandas
4. Sklearn

### Project Motivation

The blog post forms part of my data science nanodegree through Udacity. The project explores data from Airbnb rentals in Seattle, focusing on the factor influencing price. 

### File Descriptions

The are 4 files used in this project. 

1. README.md
2. Airbnb price analysis.ipynb
3. Calendar.csv (contains booking data). Data source — https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle/data
4. Listings.csv (contains listings data). Data source — https://www.kaggle.com/airbnb/seattle/data

### Results

The key findings of my project are summarised below:

1. The peak season in Seattle is during the Summer months (June to August). 
2. "Southeast Magnolia" is the most expensive neighbourhood and Rainer Beach is the cheapest, the difference between the two was an average of $300.
3. Broadway, Belltown and Wallingford are the neighbourhoods with the most listings. 
4. The size of the accomation is the greatest influencer on price. 
5. The price of the accomations also strongly correlates to the cleaning fee,  security deposit and number of amenities.
